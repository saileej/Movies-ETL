# Movies-ETL

The purpose of this challenge was to extract, transform, and load a database of movies.  More specifically, a dataset was downloaded from Kaggle, "cleaned" to get rid of duplicate or nonsense entries, and finally loaded as a clean dataset.  The dataset was cleaned using Pandas, and added into SQL.
